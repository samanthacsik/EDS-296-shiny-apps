## Functioning app for debugging practice

This is the correctly-function app that's meant to complement the [`reactlog-broken` app](https://github.com/samanthacsik/EDS430-shiny-app/tree/main/reactlog-broken), which is saved to this same repo. Instruction begins on [this slide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/EDS430-Shiny/#/debugging).

We'll cover the following:

-   isolating problematic code by commenting out as much correctly-functioning code as possible
-   adding messages to reactives
-   using `reactlog` to trace errors

We'll introduce the following packages:

-   `{reactlog}`
