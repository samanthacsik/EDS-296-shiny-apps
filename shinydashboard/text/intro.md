The [Fish Creek Watershed Observatory (FCWO)](http://www.fishcreekwatershed.org/) is a focal watershed within the [National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A)](https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/about/alaska/NPR-A). Targeted lake and stream monitoring within the watershed provide site-specific data prior to and after the establishment of new petroleum development, as well as insight into dynamics related to climate change and variability. Eleven lakes of interest (Harry Potter, Hipbone, Iceshove, L9817, L9819, L9820, Little Alaska, Lower Snowman, M9925, Middle Snowman, and Serenity) are featured in this dashboard.
