## shinydashboard using ACD data

This is the third app we'll build together during EDS 430 and uses external data downloaded from the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2JH3D41P). Instruction begins on [this slide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/EDS430-Shiny/#/building-dashboards).

We'll cover the following:

-   a general workflow for pre-processing, saving, and reading data into an app
-   using `shinydashboard` layout functions to design a dashboard UI
-   adding static images to an app
-   creating reactive `leaflet` maps

We'll introduce the following packages:

-   `{shinydashboard}`
-   `{leaflet}`
