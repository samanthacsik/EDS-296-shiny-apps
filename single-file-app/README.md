## Single-file app using `palmerpenguins` data

This is the first app we'll build together during EDS 430. Instruction begins on [this slide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/EDS430-Shiny/#/build-app1).

We'll cover the following:

-   organizing code using a single file (`app.R`)
-   adding and styling text in the UI using `tags`
-   a general workflow for practicing data wrangling & visualization *before* attemping to build reactive outputs inside the Shiny framework
-   a general workflow for builing reactive outputs
-   running and quitting qpps in RStudio

We'll introduce the following packages:

-   `{shiny}`
-   `{DT}`
-   `{tidyverse}`
-   `{palmerpenguins}`
