## Modularized Shiny app using `Gapminder` Data

This example app and code are borrowed from [Garrett Grolemund](https://github.com/garrettgman) & [Joe Cheng's](https://github.com/jcheng5) **Modules** lesson, delivered at the Shiny Developer Conference, March 20, 2016.

**Please Note:** Modules were introduced in Shiny 0.13 (Jan 2016) with `callModule()` (as demoed in G.Grolemund & J. Cheng's [workshop recording](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/shiny-dev-con/modules/?_ga=2.163786815.1475817156.1670220567-309155161.1666221806) & [associated code](https://github.com/rstudio/ShinyDeveloperConference/tree/master/Modules/Demo)) and overhauled in Shiny 1.5.0 (June 2020) with the introduction of `moduleServer()`. The modularized app code in *this* repository has been updated to reflect these new conventions (though when run, it should look exactly the same as in the video).
